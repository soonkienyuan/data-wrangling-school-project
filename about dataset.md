## Context
A retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa.
There are roughly two controls per case of coronary heart disease. Many of the coronary heart disease
positive men have undergone blood pressure reduction treatment and other programs to reduce their risk
factors after their coronary heart disease event. In some cases the measurements were made after these
treatments. These data are taken from a larger dataset, described in Rousseauw et al, 1983, South African
Medical Journal.
