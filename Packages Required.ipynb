    "## 1. Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is the core package that often used in the Be a Data Wrangler assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To store the data in readable table format, Pandas'  ``DataFrame`` will be implemented. We also used ``pd.read_csv()`` to retrieve the CSV file into `DataFrame` format.  We also use slicing to indexing the data by ``[]`` to filter the data and select particular sets of Column and Variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "we will use Numy like ``np.abs(stats.zscore(df[b]))`` and ``np.where(z>3)`` to find the location of outlier. We also us Numpy to deal with missing value like use ``np.nan`` for cleaning proccess.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is one the main visualizations library we used. ``import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`` of called to make visualization. We will use plt to make various visulization included Lollipop Chart, Tree Map, heat map and so one. For example, we use ``plt.title('Treemap of Person Helmet')`` for title.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn is another visualization library we use to illustrate the data. The reason we use seaborn is to builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Visulization like correlation heat map, pairplot and so on is build by Seaborn Library. For example, syntax like ``sns.heatmap`` for heatmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.Scipy\n",
    "We use ``Scipy.stats`` to deal with outlier. We use syntax like ``stats.zscore()`` to verify which values is outlier by Z score Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Pywaffle\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Pywaffle specifically to create Waffle chart. Syntax like ``plt.figure(FigureClass=Waffle)`` is used to produce waffle chart and be support by Matplotlib library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Squarify\n",
    "\n",
    "The Squarify is used specifically to create heatmap. Syntax like ``quarify.plot(sizes=sizes, label=labels, color=colors, alpha=.8)`` is used to produce waffle chart and be support by Matplotlib library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly is another visualization library we used. Plotly allows us to build charts for the web right from Pandas dataframe. We created pie chat, bar chat and so on using Plotly. we will import plotly as ``px``, then syntax like ``px.bar(df_pre1, x=, y,title)`` will be used to create visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Missingno\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a clean data will ultimately increase efficiency and allow for the retrieving highly informative information. One of the most common problems faced with real-time data is missing values, then Missingno can help us to get a better understanding of missing data by visualizing them. We will apply Missingno library with syntax like ``msno.matrix(dataset)`` to view the missing data in the matrix form.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "Bokeh is another powerfull library to creating interactive visualizations for modern web browsers. We use Bokeh to create beautiful and interactive map-based visualizations that working with geographical data. We also use bokeh to create time series line chat in web browsers platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. functools\n",
    "\n",
    "A module that provide various functional programming equivalent functions such as `reduce` is being used occasionally in the data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "We import datetime to convert the integer data format to time format to fulfill the need. So that we can create time series visualiztion and interactive visualizaton.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14 Pillow\n",
    "It is a Python Imaging Library. It is used to display printable image in notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15  pyproj\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyproj is a cartographic projections and coordinate transformations library, so that geospatial data can be plotted on the graph. Syntax like ``transform(outProj,inProj, df['Longitude'].min(), df['Latitude'].min())`` have been used to dealt with geospatial data and make geospatial data can be illustrated."
